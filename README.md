# NLP and TextMining

This repo stores some material from the Applied Text Mining course I attended at Utrecht Summer School in 2020. It includes lecture notes and some practical projects on text pre-processing, text classification, and word embeddings.

## Course Contents
- **Lecture Notes**: Detailed notes on text pre-processing (tokenization, lemmatization, stemming), vector representation of documents, word embeddings, and more.
- **Assignments & Projects**: Completed assignments and projects, including code and analysis reports.

## Topics Covered
- **Text Pre-processing**: Techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming.
- **Document Representation**: Understanding vector space models, bag of words, TF, and TF-IDF.
- **Text Classification**: Insights into supervised and unsupervised learning, including feature selection and optimization strategies.
- **Classification Strategies**: Binary classification, multi-class classification, and the use of various classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, and Decision Trees.
- **Feature Selection**: Techniques and importance in classification tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Focus on clustering techniques and their applications in text analysis.
- **Word Embeddings**: Exploration of Word2Vec and concepts like CBOW and Skip-gram.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries like NLTK, sklearn, spaCy,
